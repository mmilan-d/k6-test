/*
Influxdb is time series database
k6 stores perforacn results in this database
So lets execute any sample script

Lets setup Grafana dashboard

by default Grafana started on 3000 port
default user name is admin
password is admin

datasurce updated = able to connect to database, database found on 8086 port - myk6database
if database does not exists stil you can create garafana dashboard, daatbase will be created when you execute k6 script with out parameter

This is how you can send daat to db and create dashboard

Lets see live test exectuion on Grafana ****
